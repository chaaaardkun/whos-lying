Main: Why are you holding that knife?

Char A: OMG! I don't remember holding on to this! aaaaaa *throws away the knife*

Narrator: You got suspicious of her thinking she's hiding something.

Main: I'll get a hold of this knife. Don't be scared, everything will be okay. Come with me, i'll find a way out.

Char A: This place is scary. I can't go out yet, i'll stay here. I think it's safer here!

Main: Okay, but i'll be back once i found the way out.
